# Getting Started with Quickfire

Quickfire uses GPT-3 to generate responses to messages for you, as well as take your intent and build a professional message around it.

Quickfire runs as a Chrome browser extension. To use it, simply clone this repo, run 'npm install' followed by 'npm run build', then add the build folder in Chrome. To add it in Chrome, go to chrome://extensions, enable developer mode (top right corner), then click "Load Unpacked" and select the build folder. 

## Modification

The main logic for this application is in src/App.js. To modify this application, you can change the code in there and re-build the codebase to then test it out in Chrome.
